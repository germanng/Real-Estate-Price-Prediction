# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the prices of real estate based on various features such as the number of bathrooms, the location of the property, the total square meter area, the number of balconies, the number of bedrooms etc. By analyzing and processing the dataset of real estate postings, I was able to engineer features and train a machine learning model to predict prices with high accuracy.

I started by performing exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of each feature and identify any potential outliers or missing values. I then used various techniques such as feature scaling and one-hot encoding to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.

Next, I trained a linear regression model on the preprocessed data and evaluated its performance using metrics such as and R-squared. I also utilized cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance was consistent across different subsets of the data.

Finally, I created a function to predict real estate prices based on user input for various features such as availability, bath, balcony, bedroom_num, total_m2 and location.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for real estate price prediction and highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection for accurate and reliable predictions.
